# VolFx

VFX Toolkit is targeting post-processing vis buffer system<br>
that allows to build a custom scene architecture for visual effects creation âœ¨

#### Features
* Targeting post processing - can be applyed to scene objects by layers mask
* Custom passes - expandable, has minimal set of custom effects and generic blit feature
* Buffer system - can render object to buffer to make additional textures(like light maps, pattern animations, height etc) to process them and use later throug the shader for visual effect creation
* Volume controll - all build in effects controlled via volume profile and linked to a layer mask, so scene processing can be easily made dynamic
* Part of Artwork project - all effect from "PostArt" projects can be added as passes to this frameword without cluttering
* Configurable pipline - each effect can be reordered and configurade depending on application

<sup>Visual novel example, post processing applyed to scene objects by LayerMask to blur the background and fade character sprite<br>
thus you can make the appearance effect or apply graphical changes separately to scene objects</sup>

<sup>There is an example of light texture post processing generated by [GiLight](https://github.com/NullTale/GiLight2D)<br>
volume control allows to tweack texture at runtime to achive desiared light beaviour</sup>

<sup>Can have may instances order of post effects can be configured as their options</sup>

## Install and usage
Install via Unity [PackageManager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html) <br>
Add `VolFx` feature to the UrpRenderer, add post process passes to it, control via volume profile<br>
```
https://github.com/NullTale/VolFx.git
```

`VolBuffers` feature can be used to collect specific object to a texture to provide some vfx texture source<br>
that can be post processed at runtime and used later trhoug a shader
