# VolFx

VFX Toolkit is targeting post-processing vis buffer system<br>
that allows to build a custom scene architecture for visual effects creation âœ¨

### Features
* Targeting post processing - can be applyed to scene objects by layers mask
* Custom passes - expandable, has minimal set of custom effects and generic blit feature
* Buffer system - can render object to buffer to make additional textures(like light maps, pattern animations, height etc) to process them and use later throug the shader for visual effect creation
* Volume controll - all build in effects controlled via volume profile and linked to a layer mask, so scene processing can be easily made dynamic
* Part of Artwork project - all effects from "PostArt" projects can be added as passes to this frameword without cluttering
* Configurable pipeline - each effect can be reordered and configurade depending on the application

<sup>Visual novel example, post processing applyed to scene objects by LayerMask to blur the background and fade character sprite<br>
thus you can make the appearance effect or apply graphical changes separately to scene objects</sup>

<sup>There is an example of light texture post processing generated by [GiLight](https://github.com/NullTale/GiLight2D)<br>
volume control allows to tweack texture at runtime to achive desiared light beaviour</sup>

<sup>Can have may instances order of post effects can be configured as their options</sup>

## Install and usage
Install via Unity [PackageManager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html) <br>
Add `VolFx` feature to the UrpRenderer, add post process passes to it, control via volume profile<br>
```
https://github.com/NullTale/VolFx.git
```
![_Urp](https://github.com/NullTale/VolFx/assets/1497430/21dda2ff-c82e-4d46-8335-d542fc53428c)

`VolBuffers` feature can be used to collect specific object to a texture to provide some vfx texture source<br>
that can be post processed at runtime and used later trhoug a shader

## Build in Effects

Extended Color Adjustments, with the curve you can adjust the range on which part of the image to apply Color Adjustement <br>
Other option are classic exept the alpha channel that used to adjust alpha chennel to blend images properly <br>

![Adjustments](https://github.com/NullTale/VolFx/assets/1497430/af84b49d-22c3-47fd-a315-d4e8f7b35ac9)

Extended Bloom effect, threshold controlled by curve, color made with gradient(support blending) <br>
Also has some advanved options in effect passm like flickering, samples count and scuttering curve. <br>
Basically extended remplementation of moust popular effect to process the images <br>

![Bloom](https://github.com/NullTale/VolFx/assets/1497430/12475cb3-ab40-4e89-a3ac-6730155ed075)

Just simple blur with radial and distortion options

Colorization effect taken from pupular grathic editors [GradientMap](https://www.bcit.cc/cms/lib04/NJ03000372/Centricity/Domain/299/p6_howto_use_gradient_maps%2018.pdf) <br>
Wery powerfull toll to colorize and adjust images, support masking and gradient blending at runtime <br>
