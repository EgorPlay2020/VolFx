VFX Toolkit is targeting post-processing vis buffer system<br>
that allows to build a custom scene architecture for visual effects creation âœ¨

### Features
* Custom passes - expandable, has minimal set of custom effects and generic blit feature
* Targeting post processing - can be applyed to scene objects by layers mask
* Volume controll - all build in effects controlled via volume profile and linked to a layer mask, so scene processing can be easily made dynamic
* Buffer system - can render object to buffer to make additional textures(like light maps, pattern animations, height etc) to process them and use later throug the shader for visual effect creation
* Configurable pipeline - each effect can be reordered and configurade depending on the application
* Part of Artwork project - all effects from [PostArt](https://github.com/NullTale/PixelationFx) projects can be added as passes to VolFx without cluttering Volume or render feature list

Visual novel example, post processing applyed to scene objects by LayerMask to blur the background and fade character sprite<br>
thus you can make the appearance effect or apply graphical changes separately to scene objects<br>

There is an example of light texture post processing generated by [GiLight](https://github.com/NullTale/GiLight2D)<br>
volume control allows to tweack texture at runtime to achive desiared light beaviour<br>

Can have may instances order of post effects can be configured as their options<br>

## Install and usage
Install via Unity [PackageManager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html) <br>
```
https://github.com/NullTale/VolFx.git
```
Add `VolFx` feature to the UrpRenderer add post process passes to it, control via volume profile

![_Urp](https://github.com/NullTale/VolFx/assets/1497430/21dda2ff-c82e-4d46-8335-d542fc53428c)

`VolBuffers` feature can be used to collect specific object to a texture to provide some vfx texture source<br>
that can be post processed at runtime and used later throug a shader

## Build in Effects

Extended Color Adjustments, with the curve you can adjust the range on which part of the image to apply Color Adjustement <br>
Other option are classic exept the alpha channel that used to adjust alpha chennel to blend images properly <br>

![Adjustments](https://github.com/NullTale/VolFx/assets/1497430/af84b49d-22c3-47fd-a315-d4e8f7b35ac9)

Extended Bloom effect, threshold controlled by curve, color made with gradient(support blending) <br>
Also has some advanved options in effect passm like flickering, samples count and scuttering curve. <br>
Basically extended remplementation of moust popular effect to process the images <br>

![Bloom](https://github.com/NullTale/VolFx/assets/1497430/12475cb3-ab40-4e89-a3ac-6730155ed075)

Just simple blur with radial and distortion options

Colorization effect taken from pupular grathic editors [GradientMap](https://www.bcit.cc/cms/lib04/NJ03000372/Centricity/Domain/299/p6_howto_use_gradient_maps%2018.pdf) <br>
Wery powerfull toll to colorize and adjust images, support masking and gradient blending at runtime <br>
